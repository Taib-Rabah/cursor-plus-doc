## Overview

Each main group has a `wrapper` command that wraps all its commands into a single command.

Key: `cursorPlus.<group>.wrapper`

<Callout>

This page uses `cursorPlus.move.wrapper` as an example, but the concepts apply to all wrapper commands.

## Examples

### Keyboard shortcut

Instead of multiple shortcuts:

```json title="keybindings.json"
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+j j",
    "command": "cursorPlus.move.lineStart",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+j k",
    "command": "cursorPlus.move.textStart",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+j l",
    "command": "cursorPlus.move.textEnd",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+j ;",
    "command": "cursorPlus.move.lineEnd",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  }
  // ...
]
```

You can use a single wrapper shortcut:

```json title="keybindings.json"
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+j w",
    "command": "cursorPlus.move.wrapper",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  }
]
```

The wrapper command shows a menu like this:

Each command can have an alias (shown next to its name) that you can type to quickly select it. Aliases can be any length, not just single characters.

To use this feature, you need first to define your aliases.
