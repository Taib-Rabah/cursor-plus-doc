- Location: Configuration
- Key: `cursorPlus.<insert-command>.args.nextCommand`
- Description: Argument to run a command after inserting text

### Examples

Here's how to create a custom command that inserts a semicolon at line end, followed by a line break without using `nextCommand` argument.

#### Keyboard shortcut

```json title="keybinding.json"
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+;",
    "command": "runCommands",
    "args": {
      "commands": [
        {
          "command": "cursorPlus.insert.lineEnd",
          "args": {
            "text": ";"
          }
        },
        "insertLineBreak",
        "cursorDown",
        "cursorLineEnd"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

Notice that you need to press `ctrl+z` twice to undo - once for `insertLineBreak` and once for `cursorPlus.insert.lineEnd`
