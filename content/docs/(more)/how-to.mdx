## Avoid alias conflicts

Consider the following aliases:

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "cursorPlus.aliases": {
    "line": "l",
    "lineStart": "ls",
    "lineEnd": "le"
  }
}
```

It's impossible to run `lineStart` and `lineEnd` using their aliases because as soon as you type `"l"`, the `line` command is triggered.

To avoid conflicts:

- Use single-character aliases
- If not possible, add spaces or periods to make aliases unique
